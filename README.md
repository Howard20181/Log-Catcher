# Log-Catcher

Capture the boot logs to /cache/bootlog or /data/local/bootlog if /cache does not exist.

After unlocking, package them to /sdcard/Download/bootlog-**.tar.gz.

This module can help you save startup logs.

If you don't want to stop log catching after unlocking, create a file named `/data/local/logcatcher/boot.lcs`
